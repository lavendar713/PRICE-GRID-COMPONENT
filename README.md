## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Initially, i believed i could accomplish the desired result using just Flexbox alone but i realised i couldn't and so i had to do futher reading and research on CSS Grid. It wasn't much of a challenge to understand the basics of it and i was able to complete this challenge not long after.

I really had fun today, i couldn't hide my happiness after getting the desired result i hoped for. I'm really getting better at this, putting in the effort and seeing the results is just so amazing.


### Continued development

I'm definitely gonna do more studying on CSS Grid. It holds so much potential that would be of great benefit to me.  In a year's time ( 18th of July,2024), I'd look back at this and be grateful for how far i've come.
